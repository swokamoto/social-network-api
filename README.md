## Description
This is a Social Media API. It sets up the database using Mongoose. Then there are routes and controllers set up to interact with the database. There is no front end, so endpoints will need to be tested manually. New users can be created, updated and deleted. Thoughts can be added to each user, thoughts can also be updated and deleted. And finally, reactions can be left on each thought. 

## Installation
Run `npm install` to get the required packages. 
## Usage
To start the application, enter `npm start`. Then use a program such as Insomnia or Postman to interact with the server.
